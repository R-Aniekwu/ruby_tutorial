# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# EXERCISE
# Play craps (roll two dice)
# When executed, this program should print out two random
# numbers, one on each line, simulating the roll of two
# dice. Set two variables, with names that make sense,
# then write them out to the screen. Show the total
# as well.

# HINTS
# Get a random number between 1 and 6 by doing:
# rand(1..6)
# Log output to the screen with puts:
# puts "Hello, world"


#create a random number and store it in memory
# d_1 = rand(1..6)

# #create a second randmo number and store it in memory
# d_2 = rand(3..6)

# #add the two "dice" in memory together and store the total in memory
# die_sum = d_1 + d_2 
# puts die_sum

# #wrtie the first die to the screen in a user-friendly way
# puts "first die: #{d_1}"

# #wrtite the second die to the screen in a user-friendly way
# puts "Second die: #{d_2}"

# #write the total to the screen in a user-friendly way
# puts "your total is: #{die_sum}"
